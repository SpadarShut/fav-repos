## Project setup

```bash
npm i
```

### API key

- Get a Github API key at this link https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
- Paste it as a value for VITE_GITHUB_API_TOKEN in .env file, or create a .env.local file with the same content

### Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/

## Notes

For file organization in the project I experimented with [Feature-sliced design](https://feature-sliced.design).
